PRS compression/decompression utility

The PRS compression algorithm is based on LZ77 with run-length encoding
emulation and extended matches. It is used in numerous games since the
introduction of the SEGA Saturn, including Phantasy Star Universe inside
the nbl file format.

Archive of the original code from fuzziqer. No license was provided
with the released files, although fuzziqer stated using the source
freely was fine as long as he's credited for the compression and
decompression code.

See http://fuzziqer.10.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=110 for more details.
